This project is a firmware for an Atmel ATMega8 (AVR) microcontroller.

The ATMega8 based hardware connects to a slide projector via the 6 pin connector for the standard remote control.
It periodically sends "slide forward" commands to the projector. The delay between successive sends is adjustable via a potentiometer.

For further info on the hardware, please contact the author (frank_wtal@web.de)

The project uses the AVR port of the GCC compiler. avr-gcc normally ships with every state of the art linux distro. For Windows, you can install WinAVR.
I use the avr-eclipse plugin (http://http://avr-eclipse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/The_AVR_Eclipse_Plugin) which integrates nicely into Eclipse IDE.
